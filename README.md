**Abstract**
Although pneumococcal carriage duration and prevalence are lower in adults than children, carriage dynamics in adults remain poorly understood, especially in high-disease burden settings. Here, we identified and performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of longitudinal pneumococcal serotype 3 isolates with an atypical prolonged carriage episode lasting approximately one year (>335 days) in Malawi. WGS of single-colony and plate-sweep derived culture isolates confirmed prolonged carriage of a novel serotype 3 strain (ST18362), genetically closest to the dominant vaccine-failure serotype 3 lineage (GPSC10-ST700) in Malawi. Transient acquisition of other strains did not displace this strain. The longitudinally sampled isolates showed between 2-11 nucleotide base mutational differences randomly distributed across the genome, with no apparent evidence of recombination. Furthermore, the prolonged carriage isolates also harboured a similar capsule locus to GPSC10-ST700 serotype 3 isolates. The prolonged pneumococcal colonisation in an adult may constitute a reservoir facilitating long-term serotype circulation and transmission.
